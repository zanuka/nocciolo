On-demand Firstmate skill, not an always-on persona. First mate does not write product code.

## When to use

Before spawning a crewmate on a project that has a Hindsight bank registered
in \`$FM_HOME/.nocciolo/projects.json\` (or \`~/.nocciolo/projects.json\`).

## What it does

1. Resolve the project's absolute path against the captain registry to find
   its \`bankId\` and \`hindsightBaseUrl\`.
2. Append a bank card to the ship brief:
   - Bank id
   - Captain MCP URL: \`<hindsightBaseUrl>/mcp/<bankId>/\`
   - Three suggested \`recall\` queries seeded from the project's durable docs
3. Nothing else. The crewmate recalls from the bank; it does not seed or
   store, and this skill does not tell it to enable Hindsight MCP.

## What it must never do

- Never retain from chat. Never mine transcripts.
- Never call this "promote": it is a recall-only bank card.
- Never treat \`/stow\` as "run store" (those are unrelated: disk prefs vs.
  bank writes).
- Never write fleet MCP config into the product repo.

## When durable project markdown changes

The captain runs \`nocciolo store --dry-run\` in the durable clone (never in a
worktree), reviews the known/new/changed/unchanged buckets, then retains only
after picking files. This skill does not do that step; it only reads the
registry to build the bank card.
